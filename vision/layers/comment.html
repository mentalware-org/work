   Certainly we stratify not a mental work by itself but model view of this process.
</p>
<p>
   Using this approach we can improve efficiency of a real mental work of thinkers
   that is critical in expertise-driven business processes. So, here and below
   "mental work" means this model.
</p>
<p>
   On the top of mental work all concepts and semantic are collected into <b>Thesaurus</b> in order
   to structurized all the rest information and increase it is conducting power to mind.
   <b>Mind maps</b> are a good sample and visualization form for Thesaurus.
</p>
<p>
   On the base of mental work all content and meida are collected into <b>Log</b> in order
   to have arguments and data to support concepts and make decisions.
</p>
<p>
   In the middle of mental work we assumes a <b>Workflow</b> - the main
   mind process in time, consisting of decision making based on
   logic of existance, empiric facts and calculations.
</p>
</p>
   Workflow structured with terms and background from
   thesaurus (existance logic skeleton) and filled with log content (practice body).
